## Key Components

### Core Engine
- Built on Three.js for 3D rendering
- Handles physics calculations
- Manages asset loading and optimization
- Implements scene graph management

### HyperfoneOS
- Cyberpunk-themed UI system
- App management and launching
- Theme customization
- System state management

### Authentication System
- Secure user authentication
- Session management
- Protected route handling
- Integration with HyperfoneOS

## Design Principles

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separate concerns between core engine and UI
   - Pluggable component system
   - Extensible app framework

2. **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**
   - Neon color schemes
   - High-tech visual effects
   - Retro-futuristic interface elements

3. **Performance First**
   - Optimized 3D rendering
   - Efficient state management
   - Smart asset loading

4. **Security**
   - Robust authentication
   - Secure data handling
   - Protected system resources

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Three.js - 3D rendering
- React - UI framework
- @firebolt-dev/css - Styling
- WebGL - Graphics API

### Backend
- WebSocket - Real-time communication
- Asset delivery system
- State synchronization

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Building**
   ```bash
